ginnungagap
===========
_... is the formless void before all else_

These are stand-alone TypeScript utilities, not depending on any frameworks. (In other words, this is the "utils" kitchensink).

#### Undefined Handling
is heavily inspired by Guava's [Preconditions](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/PreconditionsExplained), and
null-handling in Strings, but also contains TypeScript-specific narrowing guards.

#### Comparison
has null-aware comparison, and can be used to build a comparator which compares multiple fields in objects.
It also sorts embedded numbers (integers) according to their numeric value; not their lexical order, so, say,
`A2: Something` sorts before `A10: Other`.

#### TrigramIndex
is a fuzzy search algorithm for in-memory arrays of objects. This is very effective for something like filtering lists
on a couple of keystrokes, quickly narrowing down a selection.  
If you need more full-featured text search, consider something like https://lunrjs.com/.

#### Arrays
contains a shuffle function to randomize an array ([correctly](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-danger-of-naivete/)).
