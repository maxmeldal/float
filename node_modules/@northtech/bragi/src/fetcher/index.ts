/**
 * The various fetchers mimic the native `fetch` method, adding increasingly opinionated layers on top of it.
 *  * {@link RewritingFetcher} is the most basic, simply allowing (asynchronous) manipulation of a fetch request before it is sent.
 *  * {@link JsonFetcher} adds automatic serialization and deserialization, using the {@link JsonConverter} to convert into given TypeScript types.
 *  * {@link RestFetcher} provides GET/PUT/POST/DELETE semantics for the object type handled by the underlying {@link JsonFetcher}.
